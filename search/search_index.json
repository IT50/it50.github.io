The reason behind this decline is the prosperity of services making users ignorant of the technical aspects. In this project, we bring those back to everyone who wishes to know.</p> <p>Our goal comes from the belief that everyone should be able to control their own computer systems as much as possible. To empower that, we aim to give readers a high-level cognition of how things work. This project focuses exclusively on the established concepts in computer software.</p> <p>We are aware of many other introductory guides, and we know why we are special. A professional software user does not have to be a programmer, in the same sense as drivers do not need to know how to make cars. Learning how things work at a certain level is the sweet spot for the vast majority of people, and this guide is built right at this sweet spot. If you are looking for a programming guide, then this is not the right place, although it would be very beneficial to have a look.</p> <p>We also try to build the best cognitive framework for our readers. We do not oversimplify concepts or make things unnecessarily amusing.</p> <p>Indeed, driving is a useful skill, and so is computer literacy. We are sure you are going to find its significance.</p>"},{"location":"#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>We are open to accept new contributors and unsolicited contributions.</p> <p>To submit contributions, use our GitHub repository.</p>"}]}
